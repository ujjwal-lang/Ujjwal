# Problem Statement

## Background

The used-car business is fundamentally an inventory business. Dealers purchase vehicles upfront, hold them as inventory, and attempt to sell them at a sufficient margin.

Every acquisition therefore creates a financial bet:

> "Will this vehicle sell quickly enough, at a high enough price, to justify the amount of capital I am putting into it?"

The cost of getting this decision wrong can be significant.

A vehicle that sits on a dealer's lot for 60–90 days ties up capital, incurs holding costs, becomes harder to sell as it ages, and may eventually require price reductions.

---

## Current State

The dealer's acquisition decision is typically influenced by:

* Personal experience
* Historical sales knowledge
* Auction availability
* Market reports
* Competitive listings
* Existing inventory
* Tools such as vAuto
* Gut instinct

While these sources provide useful information, the information is fragmented and in siloes.

More importantly, the dealer still needs to synthesize the information and make the final decision themselves.

---

## Core User

The primary user is the **used-car inventory manager / buyer** responsible for sourcing vehicles for a dealership.

A typical buyer may evaluate dozens of vehicles during an acquisition cycle and potentially source **20–100 vehicles per month**.

Their incentives are not simply to acquire desirable vehicles.

They need to balance:

* Inventory velocity
* Gross profit
* Acquisition price
* Local demand
* Capital utilization
* Risk

Secondary user-
* Dealer Principal- They are the ones who monitor the performance of business and managers.

## User Pain Point

The core pain point can be summarized as:

> **Dealers have access to large amounts of market and vehicle information, but lack a unified decision layer that translates that information into a clear acquisition recommendation.**

The problem is therefore not primarily lack of data.

It is the lack of **decision intelligence**.

## Business Impact

The case assumes:

* Average days-on-lot: approximately 72 days (configurable as per dealer’s business objectives)
* Gross profit per vehicle has declined approximately 18% YoY (configurable as per dealer’s business objectives)
* Dealers source approximately 20–100 vehicles per month

The target outcome is:

* Reduce average days-on-lot to below 45 days (configurable as per dealer’s business objectives)
* Increase gross profit per vehicle by 10%+ (configurable as per dealer’s business objectives)

## Jobs To Be Done

### Functional JTBD

"When I am evaluating a vehicle for acquisition, help me determine whether I should buy it and how much I should pay."

### Emotional JTBD

"Help me make the decision with confidence rather than relying entirely on intuition."

### Business JTBD

"Help me maximize inventory profitability while minimizing capital tied up in slow-moving vehicles."

---

## Problem Decomposition

The acquisition problem can be decomposed into five questions:

### 1. Demand

Will customers in my market actually want this vehicle?

### 2. Velocity

How quickly is it likely to sell?

### 3. Price

What price can I realistically sell it for?

### 4. Economics

How much profit will I make after all costs?

### 5. Risk

What could cause this vehicle to underperform expectations?

These questions collectively determine whether the acquisition is attractive.

---

## Opportunity

The opportunity is to create a decision layer that combines these dimensions and produces a simple recommendation:

**BUY / NEGOTIATE / PASS**

The complexity should remain within the system.

The dealer should not need to interpret multiple models, datasets, or market reports to make the decision.
